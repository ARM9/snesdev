Various homebrew demos for the super nintendo, with an emphasis on coprocessors.

## Requirements
make and bass in your path
## Building
Just make in a directory with a makefile and a rom should be produced.
## Running
So far any snes emulator except zsnes should work fine.<br />
There is currently no easy way to test most of these programs on hardware.
