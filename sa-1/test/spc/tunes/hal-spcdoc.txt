	Arcana (and Kirby SS for the heck of it) SPC engine document


	APU IO ports

$2140 - control port
commands

Arcana:
$ff - initiate transfer protocol, scpu should read back $DD, then write back $DD. Write word data to $2142-$2143?
$00 - music and sfx stops.
$33 - restarts tune, sfx work again.

Kirby:
$00 - music and sfx stops.
$73 - restarts tune, sfx work again.

$00 extended - after writing $00 to $2140, writes to $2141 seem to latch on $71 and $F1

$2141
Arcana & Kirby:
Write to play a sound effect

Arcana:
Writing certain values to this register causes something to go haywire and the SPC crashes after everything glitches out for a bit.
Known glitched values are:
$71
$72
$74

$7f
$ff

$2142
Seems to control "master" volume (actually used as a multiplier for the volume on the channels), eg write $00 to mute $ff for max volume.

$2143

Kirby:
Haven't found any use for this yet, seemingly does nothing.
